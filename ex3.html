        <span id="first-class" class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated JS, is a
        programming
        language that
        is one of the core technologies
        of the World Wide Web, alongside <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS.</span>[11] As of 2022, 98% of websites use
        <span class="js">JavaScript</span> on the
        client side for
        webpage behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a
        dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span>
        engine to execute the code on users' devices.

        <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the
        ECMAScript
        standard.[14] It has
        dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
        supporting
        event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces
        (APIs) for
        working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model
        (DOM).
