        The Splunk Dashboard app delivers examples that give you a hands-on way to learn the basic concepts and tools
        needed to rapidly create rich dashboards using Simple XML. This new app incorporates learn-by-doing Simple XML
        examples, including extensions to Simple XML for further customization of layout, interactivity, and
        visualizations.
        With the app you will learn basic Simple XML concepts and how to incorporate the built-in components. All the
        included examples deliver a recipe for implementing dashboard elements, beginning with the most basic and
        progressing to more advanced elements. Each example in the app includes an actual runtime visualization followed
        by a description and supporting source code.
