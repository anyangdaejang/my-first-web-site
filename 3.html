            <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that
                is one of the core technologies
                of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the
                client side for
                webpage behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a
                dedicated JavaScript
                engine to execute the code on users' devices.

                JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                standard.[14] It has
                dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
                supporting
                event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces
                (APIs) for
                working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model
                (DOM).
